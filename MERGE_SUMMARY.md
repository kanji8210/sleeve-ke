## Verification

All PHP and JavaScript files have been verified for syntax errors:
- ✓ All PHP files pass `php -l` syntax check
- ✓ All JavaScript files pass Node.js syntax validation
- ✓ No merge conflicts remain
- ✓ All files properly referenced

## Next Steps

This PR merges all feature branches into the main branch. Once merged:
1. The WordPress plugin can be installed and activated
2. User roles and database tables will be created automatically
3. Registration forms will be available for use
4. Admin dashboard will be accessible to Sleeve Admin users

## Notes

- All documentation from feature branches has been preserved in separate .md files
- The merge maintains backward compatibility with the existing folder structure from the main branch
